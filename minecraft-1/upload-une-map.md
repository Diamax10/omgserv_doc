# Add a custom map

In case we are working on a world named **world** by default.

* Stop your Minecraft server.
* Rename the new world to put in **world**.
* Connect in FTP on the server with an FTP client like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client) \([tutorial](https://www.omgserv.com/en/faq-minecraft/how_to_create_and_use_ftp_acces-86/)\) \(or with WebFTP from the OMGSERV panel but this is not recommended because many bugs\). 
* Delete the existing world folder.
* Transfer the new folder to the FTP root.

**Be careful !** This deletes the existing map, to keep it, make a backup beforehand.
{% endhint %}
