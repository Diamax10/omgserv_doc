# Backup and restore your OMGSERV server

### Make a backup

* Make the backup in the **Backups** tab.
* Lock it by clicking on the **small dots** and then on **edit** \(this ensures that nothing can delete it unless you delete it manually\).

* Optional: reinstall the server in the reinstall tab if you want to change server.
* Have fun ðŸ˜„

### Restore your backup

* Just go back to the **Backup** tab.
