# How to share your Minecraft logs?

### 6 simple steps 

1. Retrieve the last logs from your server via WebFTP or FTP with a client \(ex: Filezilla, WinSCP ...\), in the log folder the file `latest.log` and/or `fml-latest.log`.
2. Go to [haste.zendrique.ml](https://haste.zendrique.ml/).
3. Paste the content of the log file.
4. Click on the "Save" icon in the top right corner.
5. Copy the URL of the browser that must have changed.
6. Share this URL with support. 

### The server crashes? 

It must have generated a `crash-reports` folder, just copy and paste the content of the last generated file \(see the last modification date of the file\) in the tool shown above. If the text is too long, take the first 500 lines of the file.
