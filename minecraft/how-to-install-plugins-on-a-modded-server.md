# How to install plugins on a modded server

To install plugins on a modded server, **two** criteria must be met:

* Have the same version of the game.
* Use plugins that work with the type of server chosen according to the **API** it works with.

### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

**An API**? What is an API? An API or **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface is an intermediary software that allows two applications to talk to each other. In our case, it allows developers of plugins or mods to develop new features more quickly and easily on different versions of Minecraft.

#### Existing plugin's API: <a href="#api-existant" id="api-existant"></a>

* **API Bukkit-Spigot:** Plugins downloaded from the official Bukkit and Spigot websites will be compatible.
* **API SpongeForge:** Plugins downloaded from the official SpongeForge website will be compatible.
