# Install Forge with the automatic installer

**Installing Forge and its mods on its Minecraft server**

* Install forge version \(example: 1.12.2-xx.xx.x.x.xxxx\) on OMGSERV server by going to the "reinstall" menu, "Forge" then "version selection". If this one is not available, follow [this tutorial](https://docs.idelya-network.fr/minecraft/installation-de-forge-via-openmod).
* Run the server for the first time.
* Connect by FTP on the server with an FTP client such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client) \([tutorial](https://www.omgserv.com/en/faq-minecraft/how_to_create_and_use_ftp_acces-86/)\) \(or with WebFTP from the OMGSERV panel but this is not recommended because many bugs\).
* Delete the folder `world` \(it's your world, deleting it will reset it, more information with [this tutorial](https://docs.idelya-network.fr/minecraft/dois-je-supprimer-mon-monde)\). 
* Move in parallel all your mods in the `mods` folder and your `config` folder if there is one.
* Start the server and it will be accessible with all the mods.
