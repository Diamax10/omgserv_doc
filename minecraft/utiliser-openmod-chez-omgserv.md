  OpenMod allows you to add and run the .jar of your choice on your Minecraft
  server.

# Use Openmod on an OMGSERV server

## Usage

* Download the desired .jar on its **official website**.
* Do a server reinstallation with the Openmod and drag the desired **.jar**.
* Define the **.jar** at startup if requested.
* Start the server. If it does not start, check that **Java 8** is activated in the **properties** of the panel.
* Connect to the server with an FTP client such as FileZilla \(or with WebFTP on the panel\) and drag the mods into the `mods` folder, along with the configuration if there is one. 
* Finally, also delete the `world` folder to reset the map \(more information with [this tutorial](https://docs.idelya-network.fr/minecraft/dois-je-supprimer-mon-monde)\).
