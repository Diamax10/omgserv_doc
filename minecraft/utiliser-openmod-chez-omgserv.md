  server.

# Use Openmod

## Usage

* Download the desired .jar on its **official website**.
* Do a server reinstallation with the Openmod and drag the desired **.jar**.
* Define the **.jar** at startup if requested.
* Start the server. If it does not start, check the Java version in the server properties on the panel:
  * For versions below 1.16 select **Java 8**,
  * For 1.16 select **Java 11**,
  * For 1.17 select **Java 16**,
  * For 1.18 or above select **Java 17**.
* Connect to the server with an FTP client such as FileZilla (or with WebFTP on the panel) and drag the mods into the `mods` folder, along with the configuration if there is one.&#x20;
* Finally, also delete the `world` folder to reset the map (more information with [this tutorial](https://docs.idelya-network.fr/minecraft/dois-je-supprimer-mon-monde)).
